I just purchased it 4 months ago, and I have had some things change in my life and need to unload it. There is NOTHING wrong with it and I actually do love the Jeep! It still carries the factory warranty that is transferrable to a new owner with the ability to purchase an extended warranty. It is a Gladiator with the Mojave package and it rides like it's on air.  The Fox Racing suspension was definitely worth the money and the drive train is strong. The only thing I have done to it have been the AUX switches which are Mopar and installed the Mopar tonneau cover on the back. I am selling it at what I believe is an extremely fair price. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.;al;32.611442;-85.481615;2020-11-23T15:02:02-0600
