   "Description": "I'm putting up for sale my Jeep Gladiator. I just purchased it 4 months ago, and I have had some things change in my life and need to unload it. There is NOTHING wrong with it and I actually do love the Jeep! It still carries the factory warranty that is transferrable to a new owner with the ability to purchase an extended warranty. It is a Gladiator with the Mojave package and it rides like it's on air.  The Fox Racing suspension was definitely worth the money and the drive train is strong. The only thing I have done to it have been the AUX switches which are Mopar and installed the Mopar tonneau cover on the back. I am selling it at what I believe is an extremely fair price. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.",

Powered by a 3.5 Liter V6 that offers 290hp while tethered to a seamless Xtronic CVT to provide spirited passing maneuvers. This Front Wheel Drive sees near 26mpg on the open road and outside, the menacing look is completed with 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, LED taillights and dual exhaust. 4DSC also known as the four-door sports car is the only way to describe Nissan's iconic Maxima.   Step inside this 3.5 S to find a cabin that is refined and sophisticated. Power front seats, a power sliding sunroof, Bluetooth hands-free phone system, and mood lighting are just a few of the nice touches. If the cabin is too quiet for you, play your favorite tunes on the AM/FM/in-dash 6-CD changer audio system which features an auxiliary audio input jack for your convenience. You can even lower the front windows with a touch of the Intelligent key to cool things down before getting in your car on a hot summers day.   When it comes to safety, Nissan surrounds you with six airbags, the confidence of Vehicle Dynamic Control and Traction Control System as well as knowing the Maxima's construction uses a high-strength cabin structure with cross-members and rigid reinforcements. It's time to turn your dull everyday commute into an exhilarating and painless drive with one of the best-handling sports sedans on the market. Print this page and call us Now...

   "Description": "This car is in like new condition, just some spots on front seats that can be cleaned. It was bought as a gas saver for work. The only reason selling is I now have a company vehicle and never drive it any more. Body is perfect, no dents or scratches. A/C blows snowballs and heater will run you out. It gets amazing gas mileage. Most of the miles are Hwy miles, driving to work. It has been really taken care of. Regular oil changes every 3000 miles. No mechanical issues what so ever. Serious inquiries only, no low ball offers, no trades, no payments, cash only. Call or text John at 2zero5-5seven7-3zero33",
